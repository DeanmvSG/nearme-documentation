<h2 id="hallmarks-privacy-statement">Hallmark&lsquo;s Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>Hallmark and its family of companies value you and respect your privacy. It has always been Hallmark&lsquo;s firm policy to conduct business with scrupulous respect for the law. We collect information to support our relationship with you, improve our product offering and to communicate about products, services, and promotions. Hallmark recognizes that we must maintain and use information responsibly. We may disclose information to companies that work with us and assist us with providing services to you. In addition, Hallmark Gold Crown retailers receive information to communicate with you and improve your shopping experience. Occasionally, Hallmark.com uses personal consumer information to market the products and services of Hallmark Cards, Inc., its subsidiaries; and on a limited basis, we may share your contact information with trusted business partners so that they may market their products and services to you.</p>
<p>You can always find the most recent version of our privacy policy on this page.</p>

These third parties are not allowed to use this information. They can only fulfill orders and service your questions.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may share the contact information of our customers with carefully picked and trustworthy third parties so the third parties can promote their products and services. You can opt out from our sharing of your information for this particular purpose anytime by changing the preferences of your account at Hallmark.com.

<h2 id="your-california-privacy-rights">Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as S.B. 27, allows individual customers who have provided their personal information to Hallmark to request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us in one of the following ways: send a letter to Hallmark Cards Consumer Care; P.O. Box 419034; Kansas City, MO 64141; or call 1-800-HALLMARK. Within thirty days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties.

<h2 id="how-does-hallmark-handle-contest-and-survey-responses">How does Hallmark handle contest and survey responses?</h2>

The information will only be shared with third parties in grouped form.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-am-an-affiliate-partner">What if I am an affiliate partner?</h2>
<p>If you sign up to be a Hallmark.com affiliate partner, you will be led to a third-party website. This website manages the affiliate process. The third party is not allowed to use information they get for anything other than running the affiliate process.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-access-and-change-my-email-contact-preferences">How do I access and change my email contact preferences?</h2>

It also indicates that you would like to be told about special offers, products and free samples from Hallmark partners.</p>

Hover on the Hi statement in the purple bar. Select Profile and click on the Settings link at right of the page. A Communication Preferences box will appear.

<h2 id="how-secure-is-the-information-that-i-give-to-hallmark">How secure is the information that I give to Hallmark?</h2>
<p>What technology does Hallmark.com use to ensure the security of credit card transactions?</p>
<p>We seek high standards in credit card security to better protect the information you give us when you shop on Hallmark.com. Our servers use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to protect storage and transference of your data from wrongful parties. We also use a digital secure server ID to give you more security when you are on the Internet.</p>

<h2 id="how-secure-is-my-hallmark-com-account-information">How secure is my Hallmark.com account information?</h2>
<p>To protect your account information, Hallmark.com asks that you enter a valid user name and password before buying anything using your account information. We may also collect personal information to make purchasing easier for you in the future. For example, if you give us permission to store your billing information, you won&lsquo;t have to fill out the shipping and billing address each time you make a purchase on our site.</p>
<p>Hallmark also has security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and change of your information. Only certain employees and agents of Hallmark.com have access to this information. This information is only used for completing your order.</p>

<h2 id="are-my-ecard-messages-confidential">Are my ecard messages confidential?</h2>
<p>Your ecard messages are always kept confidential and secure. Ecards will only be accessed when it is necessary to complete your order. Hallmark reserves the right to work with law enforcement officials in the investigation of possible unlawful activities of our customers related to electronic communication transmitted on our site. Hallmark will have no legal responsibility for such disclosures.</p>

<h2 id="are-my-personal-messages-private-when-i-personalize-hallmark-cards-and-ecards">Are my personal messages private when I personalize Hallmark cards and ecards?</h2>
<p>When you add a personal message to your order, it is secured by Hallmark. For order fulfillment, an order-processing representative may view your message. Once again, third parties are not allowed to use this information. They can only fulfill orders and service your questions.</p>


<h2 id="address-book">Address Book</h2>
<p>Hallmark.com gives you the chance to create an online address book to keep track of important addresses once you have made a user account. Address book information is highly confidential. That information will not be used for Hallmark, or third party promotions.</p>

<h2 id="reminder-notifications">Reminder Notifications</h2>
<p>Once you have made a user account, Hallmark.com lets you set reminders for important holidays and events. Your requested reminders will often include links to our site for products and other content that you may find to be relevant to you. Reminder notification information is highly confidential and will not be shared with third parties.</p>

<h2 id="does-hallmark-com-ensure-the-security-and-privacy-practices-of-other-sites-it-links-to">Does Hallmark.com ensure the security and privacy practices of other sites it links to?</h2>
<p>While we carefully select the websites we link to, we are not at fault for the privacy practices or content of these websites. You are under the privacy policy of the operator of that site when you give personal information to them, not the Hallmark privacy policy. Please read the policy of that site before sharing any information.</p>

<h2 id="how-will-i-know-when-hallmark-changes-its-privacy-policy">How will I know when Hallmark changes its privacy policy?</h2>
<p>Our privacy policy is regularly reviewed to make sure we continue to serve the privacy interests and needs of our customers.

The new policy will apply to all current and past users of our website, and will replace any prior policies that are inconsistent. You should check our website occasionally for more information on how we use the data we collect.</p>
