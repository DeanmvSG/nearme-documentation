I play chess too, not being the best but putting a bit of the necessary focus on a good game.

Whether you may require assistance with personal care, domestic duties, transport to and from your appointments or social support, I always ensure my customers are completely satisfied by providing a quality and caring service. I always put safety first to prevent myself and my customers from any avoidable injuries. I treat my customers with respect, dignity and give the kind of care and attention as I would my own family- without crossing worker to customer professional boundaries. I feel a great sense of achievement when caring for our senior community and have been a strong advocate for promoting care to people within the privacy of their own homes. I am also known to dress up for pure entertainment purposes! Laughter really is the best medicine as some might say!","I have a certificate 3 in Aged care community services.

I have had ample experience in caring and nannying of all sorts. _x000D_
I have been a teacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aide in a support centre in Melbourne where my classroom had 8 children from age 11-15 who had autism of some sort mixed with other disabilities. Here I taught many children how to read, write, and talk to people and how to act in social situations. We would cook weekly and travel train to go to the shops to get ingredients needed. _x000D_
I have also worked with primary school aged kids in another support centre in Melbourne. This work was a lot fuller on and was all about strict routine. I have no issue with routine as I am a firm believer that a semi unchanging atmosphere is essential for some people._x000D_
My most recent job was nannying for an 11 year old boy who has ADHD and dyslexia. In this role, I took the child to many occupational therapists, speech pathologists, psychologists and his extra homework commitments. We did lots of reading and did as much extra work at home as we could. Although this was like pulling teeth sometimes- I have a lot of patience and composure and we always got the work done. _x000D_
I have a full time job as an account manager for a uniform company and occasionally babysit a 2 year old. I also play basketball at a semi-professional league (but we are in out off season) I I can help out after work hours and some weekends._x000D_
Look forward to hearing from you soon Ã¯ÂÅ _x000D_

I am a friendly, reliable, helpful 27 year old woman who has just finished cert three in disability and cert three in aged care. I am looking for work on the Sunshine Coast region as a carer.

Through both my educational and personal journey I feel I have acquired a wide range of skills, values and knowledge which i am able to offer to your team. I have held the position of a social worker in a field work, community based team and the learning disability sector. Following this i worked within the mental health sector, primarily within residential and progressed to lone working in the community. Throughout my years with the nursing agency I have worked in various teams, learning to adapt and be flexible. Coming from a large family I have also being child minding/babysitting from a young age, working with children of all ages. I also held a temporary contract for child minding two children aged 12 months and 26 months. This has provided me with valuable experience which i am eager to develop in future employment._x000D_

PROFESSIONAL PROFILE_x000D_
Throughout the intensive training programme, at college and university I have acquired a wide range of skills which I feel I have been able to implement and develop through employment. Whilst working as a team member I have been able to highlight the importance of good communication skills, both verbal and non verbal- especially whilst working with the wide range of multi- disciplinary agencies. When working within the mental health sector I became aware of the importance of thorough written reports and documentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, ensuring my audit trail was live, legible and well presented. Working with the agencies I found I was able to prioritise my day having all work completed within the deadlines. Working within the mental health and learning disability field, it was required I established a good working rapport with the service users/ clients, from the onset. I demonstrated active listening to service users needs/wishes through the appropriate use of reflection and paraphrasing. This enabled me to work in partnership to promote empowerment and allow me to effectively work as an advocate. _x000D_
Throughout my employment I understand the importance of maintaining confidentially with service users, respecting their privacy within the Human Rights Legislation, policies and procedures. Through effective and holistic assessments I identified the appropriate social work method, framework and theories, whilst acknowledging each individuals unique needs. _x000D_
Social work presents as a complex job and requires me to act as an advocate and pro-actively use my knowledge, skills and values as a skilled worker. Through further training and regular supervision I aim to enhance my professional development._x000D_

My nursing experience has given me confidence in personal care, and I have worked with people with varying degrees of intellectual and physical disability.","I have a bachelor in nursing, which I am not practising anymore due to a desire for career change. My experience as a general nurse, intensive care nurse and paediatric nurse has given me confidence in personal care practises and medication administration, among other things. I have a graduate certificate in loss, grief and trauma counselling, which has given me some theory on understanding different painful experiences people experience in their lives. I am currently studying a diploma in early childhood education and care. I work in the disability field as a support worker, and I also work with family day care as a co-educator.",,"on","on","on","on","on","on","on",,,"on","on","on","on",,,,"on",,,,"on","on","Y",30,,27,,"on","on",,0,01/09/2015,"1.137.32.146"

The service is called MINDFUL BODY &amp; SOUL SUPPORT.  I believe support needs to be delivered in the form of holistic healing interventions that include the overall person physically, mentally and emotionally all at the same time.  Often people requiring support have a dual diagnosis. Often the second diagnosis has resulted from side effects of pain or medication or even service delivery causing trauma or saturation.  Some of the people I have worked with had very challenging behaviours when I commenced working with them.  After a while I figured out what needed to be changed in the service delivery in order for the person receiving support was most happy and comfortable.  As a result in one service I worked at for 2.5 years, the 2 men living in the facility had daily violent altercations with each other and staff.  After 6 months their behaviours had decreased and the violence was reduced to 1-2 altercations per month.  I actually supported one of the men by becoming a volunteer at the local op-shop so that he could become a volunteer too. Many jaws were on the floor, as reputations of the house I worked at were of dread and despair as many support workers had literally fled the house for their lives.    _x000D_

I have been a registered nurse in the Philippines since 2011. Currently, I am taking up Bachelor of Nursing at Australian Catholic University Melbourne. Although I am a risk-taker, I am still careful in making personal and professional decisions and always into consideration other&#039;s sake.","1.	My passion for this job is insurmountable because whenever I do my job in this kind of setting, I wholeheartedly care for my patients as if they are my family/relatives and I efficiently finish my duties and responsibilities._x000D_
2.	Caring for the elderly with various needs and issues is truly rewarding and is an experience that is worth-having. It prepares everyone, especially health professionals, in helping these people in maintaining optimal health and function in spite of their condition._x000D_
3.	With my two years of work in an aged care facility in Singapore, I was more than contented with the experiences that I had in caring for the elderly. I faced most of the difficult challenges in my profession so far and I became a part of a culture that most of the time entrusts the lives of their own flesh and blood to nursing home management with high demands. I handled a population of old and demented residents who did not even know who and what I was, and what I did for them. Their difficult attitudes, behaviors and conditions encouraged me more to take up every challenge and to be a better person. This job taught me to widen more my patience and understanding. It clearly showed me the importance of life and of valuing it. It was not perfect, there were cultural differences, misunderstandings and a lot of stressors, but it was indeed exceptional and incomparable as it molded not only my skills in caring for the elderly, the sick and the dying, but also my character. And now, I want to relive the experience in a whole new environment where I can share my commitment, experiences, and dedication to this career._x000D_
4.	I was able to get hired in Orange Valley Nursing Home Singapore after I directly applied and passed my qualifications to their human resource department, in which they critically reviewed it and accepted it as well._x000D_
5.	My previous aged care experience tested my flexibility, adaptability and problem solving skills most of the time as there were understaffed duties in which I had to do several roles to keep up the pace of work and to render quality service to the patients. As the assistant level supervisor, I was also involved in critical thinking and brainstorming for the solution of our patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ problems and on how to meet their needs._x000D_
6.	I can finish on time any task that is given to me and I assure that the quality of my work is more than satisfactory. From my previous experience working in a team, I can prove that I am a team player as I give full respect and understanding to every member and offer my best hand to them. I assure that everyone feels welcomed, supported, and motivated to do their work because I strongly believe that no man is an island.","on","on","on","on","on","on","on","on",,,"on","on",,"on",,,,"on",,,,,"on","Y",10,,17,,,"on",,0,05/16/2015,"60.241.201.138"

My name is Robyn, although I have been nicknamed Lili for the past 35 years.  I am a teacher by profession.  I have also been a private governess for many years.  My last job finished two months ago when I returned from spending over a year in Thailand as manager of a girls boarding school.  I have returned to Perth and am looking for a permanent position.  _x000D_
_x000D_
I have had a lot of experience working with children of all ages where I have been responsible for departments within large boarding schools.  I also helped set up several international boarding schools.  I am now interested in slowing down my pace of life and leaving the bigger institution situation and having returned to Australia to be closer to my ages ailing father I felt that perhaps aged care would suit me as I have a great respect for the elderly and the lives they have lived. When visiting my father in Melbourne I saw there were carers that should not have been carer.  This did greatly affect me as these old people deserve kindness and respect.  _x000D_
_x000D_
I am very organised and clean.  I do believe I have a positive and cheerful disposition which is what the elderly need.  I am an idea person, a trouble shooter and see the need for kind and caring carers for the old.  _x000D_

Last year I completed my studies with Health Skills Australia (HSA) Navitas to obtain Certificate III (CHC30212), a Dual Course for Assistant in Nursing in Aged Care &amp; Home and Community Care. &amp; I satisfactorily concluded the compulsory job placement (160 hours) at an accredited Aged Care Facility, where I realised that I found my new Profession for life: caring for the elderly.After completing my course with HSA Navitas, I continued my studies in this field by completing successfully short online courses in Dementia (5 units), Assisting Clients with Medication &amp; Medication Calculations Competency with ACSA (Aged &amp; Community Services Australia) &amp; 6 modules in Palliative Care with Palliative Care with certificates issued &amp; am willing to learn more.

Being a widow, living alone with my cat for more than a decade, I realised that I had so much loving care built up in me, waiting for a chance to nurture human beings. Caring for the residents at the Aged Care Facility has given me such a satisfaction &amp; reason for living: to cherish the fading souls &amp; protect the frail bodies of the residents, whom have lost their physical &amp; cognitive functions due to the consequences of the ageing process &amp; to enrich the final stages of their lives with my affectionate nature.

The two most recent took place in a Residential Aged Care facility and a Rehabilitation Ward, where I was exposed to both physical and intellectual disabilities across all ages ranging from 20 years old to 85 years old. I also completed my Certificate III in Aged Care at the beginning of 2015, where I also took part in 4 weeks of practical placement in a Residential Aged Care Facility.

My times and days are a lot more flexible than stated However I am not available on Thursdays.","Although I have had no formal training I love to take care of others.  I however nursed my grandmother for many years until her passing at the age of 98 as well as taking care of her household tasks. I also, assisted in the care of my father in law who was struck with cancer and sadly passed away late last year.

My roles included observing development, specific 1:1 care, implementing individual care and learning plans, following EYLF curriculum providing structured activities and free flowing play sessions, maintaining a safe and clean environment for all setting users.

After approximately a yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wait, she underwent the surgery which was highly successful and I subsequently returned to Brisbane and to my work as a lawyer.  However, I realised that my true calling was not as a lawyer but as a carer.

I am wanting to take a break from teaching preparation and marking and take on a Carer role which will allow me to go on working with people, which is my main passion, but with flexible hours to work around my voluntary advocacy work and charitable interests in Africa, along with my own writing. I would certainly enjoy taking you out and about, cups of tea or helping prepare light meals in your home and giving the place a tidy up and so on.","I have many academic qualifications such as a BA, 3 Graduate Diplomas and a Master degree (one Grad Dip and the Master being from ANU), and over 15 years of experience teaching all ages, but in the latter years, especially in institutions of higher learning including ANU. I was always interested in social work and as a teenager I worked and volunteered in retirement homes, a children&#039;s home and also ran a local youth club, but finally I went into teaching more as a means to travel. I have lived and worked in 9 countries including Australia, and Nauru Island teaching refugees for 2 months in 2016. I have also visited around 40. All of my travelling has helped me develop a knack for adapting to any circumstance and being able to communicate with every kind of person, no matter what their race or creed. I have also travelled extensively in Australia and find that it is one of the world&#039;s most amazing countries! I would be most interested in spending time with you and getting out from behind my desk to form lasting friendships myself, so I see being a Carer as a win win experience! I recently returned to Canberra because my youngest daughter is studying here, and my other daughter lives on the coast, so it&#039;s nice to be close to hand.

 Organisation, I am a highly organised person, with a great attention to detail. I am very well at time managing, working under pressure to a schedule, decision making, predicting risks and collecting and organising information. _x000D_
Communication skills, throughout my volunteer work and employment I have had to communicate with other employees and customers/clients. Listening, understanding and empathising. I pride myself in being able to deal with confrontation and negotiate with others. _x000D_
Being accountable, I am a very reliable person. I know my limitations and always keep in close contact with management. _x000D_
Patience, I find that patience is one of my strongest qualities. When working with children with behavioural issues, I have demonstrated care and patients to resolve the situation calmly._x000D_
Self-motivation, I am not easily shaken. I have a strong resilience and know myself well in dealing with stress. Within my volunteer work I have had times were I could easily take situation personally but I have always seemed to maintain an outlook at the bigger picture. _x000D_
Peer support, Livewires has faced with me with a lot of different situations. From these situations I now know how to comfort and calm a child, deal with mediation between peers and discipline respectfully. I am able to work on an equal level with all children and gain respect when leading a team._x000D_
