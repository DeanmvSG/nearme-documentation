Dr. Mowbray’s background includes over 20 years’ experience computer science research including topics such as: programming languages, mobile robotics, parallel processing, image understanding, visual simulation, and software architectures. </p>

                    <h3>Education, Certifications and Training</h3>
                    <p>Dr. Mowbray holds the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, the M.S. degree in Computer Engineering from Stanford University, and the Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California.</p>

                    <h3>Awards and Honors</h3>
                    <p>In 1996, DISCUS received an award from COMPUTERWORLD as an outstanding object-oriented application system.  The DISCUS case study is documented in the book "The Essential CORBA" (Wiley 1995).</p>

                    <h3>Professional Service</h3>
                    <p>Currently, Dr. Mowbray is a full time Software Architect consulting to major fortune 500 companies in the United States and organizations worldwide. He has applied architecture design patterns and Open Distributed Processing in multiple domains, including: data communications, business information technology, Internet-based information retrieval, finance, and accounting. Currently, Dr. Mowbray has been honored with as the Chief Scientific Technical Officer of the European Esprit COMPASS project, the first IT standards project for the accounting domain. In addition, Dr. Mowbray is the Chief Scientist of the Component Management Group™, a non-profit software professional organization, founded in India.</p>

                    <p>In 1991, Dr. Mowbray became Principal Investigator of the Data Interchange and Synergistic Collateral Usage Study (DISCUS), the US government’s first CORBA project. DISCUS evolved into 4 major testbed iterations that proved the feasibility of system interoperability across a broad range of commercial and legacy software systems. </p>

                    <p>In 1995, Dr. Mowbray was project lead for the Information Access Services Specification (IASS).  Within two years, this initiative solved the key interoperability challenge for the geospatial and imagery user community.  IASS is supported by a formal test suite from the Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC), and is utilized in several major National Imagery and Mapping Agency procurements.  A case study of the IASS activity is documented in the book "Inside CORBA" (Addison-Wesley 1997).</p>

                    <p>From 1993 until 1997, Dr. Mowbray was a Principal Representative to the Object Management Group (OMG), an industry standards group.  At the Object Management Group, Dr. Mowbray was recently honored as an OMG Fellow and former chair of the CORBAfacilities Task Force.  In CORBAfacilities, he led the effort to architect the expansion of the OMG into horizontal facilities and vertical domains.  Dr. Mowbray was also Chairman of the OMG Command, Control, Computer, Communications, and Intelligence Working Group (OMG C4I). This group is defining object-oriented standards for C4I systems interoperability.  Dr. Mowbray also chaired the Interface Definition Language (IDL) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) Patterns and Metrics Working Group.  This group has defined the specification style guide being used by U.S. government for specifications compliant with the International Standards Organization’s Open Distributed Processing IDL (ISO ODP IDL).</p>
