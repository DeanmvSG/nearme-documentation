<p><u><strong>Borrower Refund Policy</strong></u></p>
<p>Items on The Volte platform should be consistent with the description provided by the Lender. If a Borrower who books and pays for an Item and then experiences a &lsquo;Renting Issue&rsquo;, the Borrower may be eligible for a refund in accordance with this Borrower Refund Policy.</p>
<p>The Volte may (at our discretion) provide the Borrower with either a full or partial refund excluding any shipping costs, administration fees and processing fees.</p>
<p>A valid <strong>'Renting Issue</strong>' generally falls into three categories:</p>


<ol>
<li>The Lender cancels a reservation 24 hours or less before the scheduled arrival of the Item, or fails to provide the Borrower with the Item.</li>
<li>The description of the Item in the Listing on The Volte is materially different from the actual Item. The Volte reminds Borrowers that Items are potentially pre-worn and are not rented on an as-new basis. Some minor wear and tear may not be listed in the description but can not be used as a basis to provide a refund under this policy.</li>
<li>At the start of the Borrower&rsquo;s reservation, the Item: (i) is not generally clean and sanitary (ii) contains safety or health hazards that would be reasonably expected to adversely affect the Borrower&rsquo;s use of the Item in The Volte&rsquo;s judgment.</li>
</ol>

<br />

<p>To submit a valid claim for a refund, a Borrower is required (a) to bring the Renting Issue to our attention within 2 hours after receipt of the item (including photographs or other evidence) and respond to our requests for information or cooperation, (b) not have directly or indirectly caused the Renting Issue and (c) to have used reasonable efforts to try to remedy the circumstances of the Renting Issue with the Lender prior to making a claim for a Renting Issue.</p>



<p><u><strong>Cancellation Policies</strong></u></p>

<p>The Volte allows Lenders to choose amongst four standardised cancellation policies (Flexible, Moderate, Strict, Super Strict) that we will enforce to protect both Borrower and Lender alike. Each listing and reservation on our site will clearly state the chosen cancellation policy. Borrowers agree to the chosen cancellation policy when they request to rent the item.</p>
