            Who we are
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Volte is an online marketplace connecting savvy Cinderellas to a community of Fairy Godmothers. The Volte enables members to both borrow and lend high end designer wear to make the everyday just a little more special.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What we believe
          </h3>
          <p>
            Fashion should not be exclusive. No more prom queens, no more devils in Prada. Access is the new ownership and the Volte makes that happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are championing a new model of retail that enables individuals to experience beautiful aspirational products in their everyday life while also harnessing their own wardrobe to generate income.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also believe that sharing in the 21st century is both ethically and environmentally responsible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our model also supports the fashion industry â€“ we champion designers and allow up and coming designers to reach new markets through the designer dress rental industry.
          </p>
