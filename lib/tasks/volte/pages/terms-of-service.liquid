<p><strong>How the Site and Services Work</strong></p>
<p>The Site and Services can be used to facilitate the listing and renting of fashion items (&ldquo;<strong>Item</strong>&rdquo;). Such Items are included in Listings on the Site and Services by Lenders. You may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to the Site and Services; however, if you wish to book an Item or create a Listing, you must first register to create a The Volte Account (defined below).</p>
<p>As stated above, The Volte makes available an online platform or marketplace with related technology for Lenders and Borrowers to meet online and arrange for the rental of Items directly with each other. The Volte is not an owner or dealer of fashion items, including, but not limited to, dresses, shoes, bags or accessories, nor is it a provider of fashion items, including, but not limited to, dresses, shoes, bags or accessories and The Volte does not own, sell, resell, provide, rent, re-rent, manage and/or control fashion items, including, but not limited to, dresses, shoes, bags or Items or postal, courier or other delivery services. The Volte has engaged the service of a courier company on behalf of its members. However, The Volte does not provide these Courier Services and accepts no liability for any damage caused in any way through or by the Courier Service. It is a condition of every transaction that is entered into on the Site that the Courier Service will be used to deliver the Item to the Borrower and return the Item to the Lender. If a User does not wish to use the Courier Service, the User is breaching a term of this Agreement and must not use the Site or Services.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE LENDERS AND BORROWERS CONNECTING AND RENTING ITEMS DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. THE VOLTE CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY ITEMS. THE VOLTE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS AND ITEMS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY RENTALS WILL BE MADE AT THE MEMBER&rsquo;S OWN RISK.</p>
<p><strong>Account Registration</strong></p>
<p>In order to access certain features of the Site and rent an Item or create a Listing, you must register to create an account (&ldquo;<strong>The Volte Account</strong>&rdquo;) and become a Member. You may register to join the Services directly via the Site or as described in this section.</p>
<p>You can also register to join by logging into your account with certain third-party social networking sites (&ldquo;<strong>SNS</strong>&rdquo;) (including, but not limited to, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter; each such account, a &ldquo;<strong>Third-Party Account</strong>&rdquo;), via our Site, as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site and Services, you may link your The Volte Account with Third-Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third-Party Account login information to The Volte through the Site or Services; or (ii) allowing The Volte to access your Third-Party Account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to The Volte and/or grant The Volte access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating The Volte to pay any fees or making The Volte subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting The Volte access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that The Volte will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (&ldquo;<strong>SNS Content</strong>&rdquo;) so that it is available on and through the Site and Services via you&rsquo;re the Volte Account and The Volte Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through your The Volte Account on the Site and Services. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or The Volte&rsquo;s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site and Services. You have the ability to disable the connection between your The Volte Account and your Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; section of the Site. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. The Volte makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and The Volte is not responsible for any SNS Content.</p>
<p>We will create your The Volte Account and your The Volte Account profile page for your use of the Site based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active The Volte Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. The Volte reserves the right to suspend or terminate your The Volte Account and your access to the Site and Services if you create more than one (1) The Volte Account or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your The Volte Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify The Volte of any unauthorized use of your The Volte Account.</p>
<p><strong>Item Listings</strong></p>
<p>As a Member, you may create Listings. To create a Listing, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Item to be listed, including, but not limited to, your location, designer, size, occasion, colour, recommended retail price, any existing defects, description and availability of the Item and rental pricing and related rules (for instance dry cleaning responsibility) and financial terms (including bond amounts). Listings will be made publicly available via the Site and Services. Other Members will be able to rent your Items via the Site and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Borrower requests a rental of your Item, you may not request the Borrower to pay a higher price than in the rental request.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Listings you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the rental of an Item in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Item included in a Listing you post, and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that The Volte assumes no responsibility for a Lender&rsquo;s compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Volte reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that The Volte, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or The Volte&rsquo;s then-current Policies (at&nbsp;www.thevolte.com), or otherwise harmful to the Site or Services.</p>
<p>If you are a Lender, you understand and agree that The Volte does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Borrower requests a rental of your Item and rents your Item, any agreement you enter into with such Borrower is between you and the Borrower and The Volte is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, The Volte serves as the limited authorized payment collection agent of the Lender for the purpose of accepting, on behalf of the Lender, payments from Borrowers of such amounts stipulated by the Lender.</p>
<p>If you are a Lender, The Volte makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm for renting your Items. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Lender, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions. Please see Lender Tips (at&nbsp;www.thevolte.com) for further information.</p>
<p>The Volte recommends that Lenders obtain appropriate insurance for their Items. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Items carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Borrowers while renting your Items.</p>
<p>The Volte may at their own discretion have Members&rsquo; Items verified by a representative of The Volte and this verification will be made available to you to include in your Listing with a watermark or tag bearing the words &ldquo;The Volte Verified&rdquo; or similar wording (&ldquo;<strong>Verified Images</strong>&rdquo;).</p>
<p><strong>No Endorsement</strong></p>
<p>The Volte does not endorse any Member or any Item. You understand that Verified Images are intended only to indicate a photographic representation and description of the Item at the time the The Volte representative sights the Item. Verified Images are therefore not an endorsement by The Volte of any Member or any Item. Members are required by these Terms to provide accurate information, and although The Volte may undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of users, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Member or the Member&rsquo;s purported identity or background.</p>
<p>Any references in the Site or Services to a Member being &ldquo;verified&rdquo; or &ldquo;connected&rdquo; (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by The Volte about any Member, including of the Member&rsquo;s identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to rent an Item or to accept a rental request from a Borrower, or to have any other interaction with any other Member.</p>
<p>By using the Site or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from The Volte with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any rentals or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Lender against The Volte regarding the remittance of payments received from a Borrower by The Volte on behalf of a Lender, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled &ldquo;Limitation of Liability&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Courier Services</strong></p>
<p>The Volte provides Members access to an integrated third party door-to-door courier service. Note that all transactions are subject to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items passes between the Lender and the Borrower. The Volte is not a party to such shipment contract. The Volte disclaims any loss or liability whatsoever arising from the user any such Courier Services.</p>
<p>Courier Fees are based on the size of the package selected by the Lender. If it is deemed by The Volte, in its absolute discretion, that the package does not comply with the dimensions selected, The Volte is entitled to claim additional fees from the Member. For the avoidance of doubt, these additional fees may include any additional amounts that would have been payable by the Borrower if the Lender uses the incorrect packaging size.</p>
<p><strong>Photo Editing Services</strong></p>
<p>The Volte has partnered with a third party Photo Editing Service to assist Lenders in improving their photos for use on the Site. If a Lender chooses to use the Photo Editing Services The Volte will charge the Lender a Photo Edit Fee. Currently, this is an optional service.</p>
<p><strong>Rentals and Financial Terms</strong></p>
<p><em>Key definitions</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Rental Fees</strong>&rdquo; means the amounts that are due and payable by a Borrower in exchange for that Borrower&rsquo;s use of an Item. The Lender alone, and not The Volte, determines these amounts. The Lender may in his or her sole discretion decide to include in these amounts (i) a dry cleaning fee or any other fee permitted on The Volte platform.<br /> &ldquo;<strong>Borrower Fees</strong>&rdquo; means the fee that The Volte charges a Borrower for the use of its online platform, which is calculated as 5% of the applicable Rental Fees. The Borrower Fees will be displayed to the Borrower when the Borrower is asked whether to send a rental request to a Lender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Courier Fees&rdquo;</strong> means the fee the Borrower and/or Lender pays for use of the Courier Services. These fees are based on capacity. For more information please see [www.thevolte.com]. If a package is larger than what you elected initially you will be charged for the additional amounts incurred by The Volte. <br /> &ldquo;<strong>Lender Fees</strong>&rdquo; means the fee that The Volte charges a Lender for the use of its online platform, which is calculated as 15% of the applicable Rental Fees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Photo Edit Fee&rdquo;</strong> means the fee the Volte charges to the Lender to edit the Lender&rsquo;s photographs for use on the Site. Currently the Photo Edit Fee is calculated as US$3.00 per photograph.<br /> &ldquo;<strong>Service Fees</strong>&rdquo; means collectively the Borrower Fees and the Lender Fees.&nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;<strong>Total Fees</strong>&rdquo; means collectively the Rental Fees, Borrower Fees and Courier Fees.</p>
<p><em>Rentals and Financial Terms for Lender</em></p>
<p>If you are a Lender and a rental is requested for your Item via the Site, Application and Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the rental request within the Rental Request Period, otherwise the rental request may be automatically cancelled. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a rental request within the Rental Request Period, any amounts (if any) collected by The Volte for the requested rental will be refunded to the applicable Borrower&rsquo;s credit card and any pre-authorisation of such credit card (if any) will be released.</p>
<p>The Volte will collect the Total Fees at the time of rental confirmation (i.e. when the Lender confirms the rental request) and will initiate payment of the Rental Fees to the Lender within 48 hours of when the Borrower is scheduled to receive the Item (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Borrower).</p>
<p>If you owe or agree to pay any amount to The Volte (whether as a result of your The Volte or actions as a Borrower or otherwise), then The Volte may (but is not obliged to) withhold the amount owing to The Volte from any payout amounts due to you as a Lender, and use the withheld amount to set-off the amount owed by you to The Volte. If The Volte does so, then your obligation to pay The Volte will be extinguished to the extent of the amount withheld by The Volte, and The Volte will cease to owe to you any obligations (including, but not limited to, any obligation to pay you) with respect to the amount withheld.</p>
<p><em>Appointment of The Volte as Limited Payment Collection Agent for Lender</em></p>
<p>Each Lender hereby appoints The Volte as the Lender&rsquo;s limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Rental Fees from Borrowers.</p>
<p>Each Lender agrees that payment made by a Borrower through The Volte shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Lender, and the Lender will make the Item available to the Borrower in the agreed-upon manner as if the Lender has received the Rental Fees. Each Lender agrees that The Volte may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Lender and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Borrower to cancel the rental and (ii) refund to the Borrower that portion of the Rental Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. Each Lender understands that as The Volte accepts payments from Borrowers as the Lender&rsquo;s limited payment collection agent, The Volte&rsquo;s obligation to pay the Lender is subject to and conditional upon The Volte successfully receiving the payments from Borrowers. The Volte does not guarantee payments to Lenders for amounts that have not been successfully received from Borrowers. In accepting appointment as the limited authorised agent of the Lender, The Volte assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Lender.</p>
<p>Please note that The Volte does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you as a Lender acknowledge and agree that The Volte reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings. Please note that The Volte will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site, Application and Services, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.</p>
<p><em>Rental and Financial Terms for Borrowers</em></p>
<p>The Lenders, not The Volte, are solely responsible for honouring any confirmed rentals and making available any Items reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Borrower, choose to enter into a transaction with a Lender for the rental of an Item, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Lender and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Item imposed by the Lender. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not The Volte, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that The Volte is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, The Volte disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that The Volte is not a party to the agreement between you and the Lender, The Volte acts as the Lender&rsquo;s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Lender. Upon your payment of the Total Fees to The Volte, your payment obligation to the Lender for the Item Fees is extinguished, and The Volte is responsible for remitting the Item Fees (less The Volte&rsquo;s Lender Fees and relevant Courier Fee), in the manner described in these Terms. In the event that The Volte does not remit any such amounts as described in these Terms, such Lender will have recourse only against The Volte.</p>
<p>The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a Borrower before the Borrower sends a rental request to a Lender. As noted above, the Lender is required to either confirm or reject the rental request within the Rental Request Period, otherwise the requested rental will be automatically cancelled. If a requested rental is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Lender), any amounts collected by The Volte will be refunded to such Borrower, depending on the selections the Borrower makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorisation of such Borrower&rsquo;s credit card will be released, if applicable.</p>
<p>You as a Borrower agree to pay The Volte for the Total Fees for any rental requested in connection with your The Volte Account if such requested rentals are confirmed by the applicable Lender. In order to establish a rental pending the applicable Lender&rsquo;s confirmation of your requested rental, you understand and agree that The Volte, on behalf of the Lender, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorisation via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting (e.g. one euro or one British pound), to verify your credit card. Once The Volte receives confirmation of your rental from the applicable Lender, The Volte will collect the Total Fees in accordance with these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that The Volte cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Borrower by his or her bank related to The Volte&rsquo;s collection of the Total Fees, and The Volte disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>
<p>In connection with your requested rental, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to The Volte or its third-party payment processor. You agree to pay The Volte for any confirmed rentals made in connection with your The Volte Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application, e.g. by PayPal or credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the rental, either directly by The Volte or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. You also authorize The Volte to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused to an Item as contemplated under &ldquo;Damage to Items&rdquo; below or non-return of an Item and for Security Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to The Volte&rsquo;s third-party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party&rsquo;s service and that third party&rsquo;s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed rental transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed rental.</p>
<p><strong>Security Deposits</strong></p>
<p>Lenders may choose to include security deposits in their Listings (&ldquo;<strong>Security Deposits</strong>&rdquo;). Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Item. Lenders acknowledge that no authorisation is made over the relevant Borrower&rsquo;s card and no charges are taken from the relevant Borrower. The Volte will use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Lenders&rsquo; requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but The Volte is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Lenders related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>Service Fees</strong></p>
<p>In consideration for the use of The Volte&rsquo;s online marketplace and platform, The Volte charges the Service Fees. Where applicable, Taxes (such as VAT in Europe or GST in Australia) may also be charged in respect of the Lender Fees and Borrower Fees. The Volte deducts the Lender Fees from the Rental Fees before remitting the balance to the Lender as described in these Terms. Borrower Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.</p>
<p>Balances will be remitted by The Volte to Lenders via (in The Volte&rsquo;s sole discretion) payment methods described on the Site or via the Application, depending upon the selections the Lender makes via the Site, Application and Services. Amounts may be rounded up or down as described the &ldquo;Rounding Off&rdquo; section below.</p>
<p>More information on Services Fees can be found at&nbsp;[www.thevolte.com]. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.</p>
<p><strong>General Rental and Financial Terms</strong></p>
<p><em>Cancellations and Refunds</em></p>
<p>If, as a Borrower, you cancel your requested rental before the requested rental is confirmed by a Lender, The Volte will cancel any pre-authorisation to your credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested rental within a commercially reasonable time. If, as a Borrower, you wish to cancel a confirmed rental made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after receiving the Item, the cancellation policy of the Lender contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation. Our ability to refund the Rental Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site. The Borrower Fee is non-refundable regardless of the cancellation policy selected by the Lender. Please see our Cancellation Policy at [www.thevolte.com] for further information.</p>
<p>If a Lender cancels a confirmed rental made via the Site, (i) The Volte will refund the Total Fees for such rental to the applicable Borrower within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation and (ii) the Borrower may receive an email or other communication from The Volte containing alternative Listings and other related information. If the Borrower requests a rental from one of the alternative Listings and the Lender associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Borrower&rsquo;s requested rental, then the Borrower agrees to pay The Volte the Total Fees relating to the confirmed rental for the Item in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms. If a Lender cancelled a confirmed rental and you, as a Borrower, have not received an email or other communication from The Volte, please contact The Volte at [www.thevolte.com].</p>
<p>If, as a Lender, you cancel a confirmed rental, The Volte may apply penalties or consequences to you or your Listing, including (i) publishing an automated review on your Listing indicating that a reservation was cancelled, (ii) keeping the calendar for your Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled rental, or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee (to be withheld from your future payouts). You will be notified of the situations in which a cancellation fee applies before you decide to cancel.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, The Volte may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed rental made via the Site and Services. This may be for reasons set forth in The Volte&rsquo;s Extenuating Circumstances Policy at [www.thevolte.com]&nbsp;or for any other reason. The Volte may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the Borrower part or all of the amounts charged to the Borrower in accordance with the Borrower Refund Policy at&nbsp;[www.thevolte.com]. You agree that The Volte and the relevant Borrower or Lender will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.</p>
<p><em>Borrower Refunds</em></p>
<p>Items on The Volte platform should be consistent with the description provided by the Lender. If a Borrower who books and pays for an Item and then experiences a &lsquo;Renting Issue&rsquo;, the Borrower may be eligible for a refund.</p>
<p>The Volte may (at our discretion) provide the Borrower with either a full or partial refund excluding any shipping costs, administration fees and processing fees.</p>
<p>A valid <strong>'Renting Issue</strong>' generally falls into three categories:</p>

<ol>
<li lang="en-US">The Lender cancels a reservation 24 hours or less before the scheduled arrival of the Item, or fails to provide the Borrower with the Item.</li>
<li lang="en-US">The description of the Item in the Listing on The Volte is materially different from the actual Item. The Volte reminds Borrowers that Items are potentially pre-worn and are not rented on an as-new basis. Some minor wear and tear may not be listed in the description but can not be used as a basis to provide a refund under this policy.</li>
<li lang="en-US">At the start of the Borrower&rsquo;s reservation, the Item: (i) is not generally clean and sanitary (ii) contains safety or health hazards that would be reasonably expected to adversely affect the Borrower&rsquo;s use of the Item in The Volte&rsquo;s judgment.</li>
</ol>

<p>To submit a valid claim for a refund, a Borrower is required (a) to bring the Renting Issue to our attention within 2 hours after receipt of the item (including photographs or other evidence) and respond to our requests for information or cooperation, (b) not have directly or indirectly caused the Renting Issue and (c) to have used reasonable efforts to try to remedy the circumstances of the Renting Issue with the Lender prior to making a claim for a Renting Issue.</p>
<p><em>Rounding Off</em></p>
<p>The Volte may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Borrowers or Lenders to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, The Volte will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00.</p>
<p>Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, The Volte may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for The Volte to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p>
<p><em>Payment Processing Errors</em></p>
<p>We will take steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the same payment method used for the original payout to or payment by you, so that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Donations</em></p>
<p>Some Lenders may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed rentals made via the Site, Application and Services to a particular cause or charity. We do not take any responsibility or liability for whether the Lender does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make. In such cases, the Lender in question is responsible for his or her own compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to such pledges and/or fund-raising.</p>
<p><em>Taxes</em></p>
<p>You as a Lender understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. The Volte cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members.</p>
<p><em>Damage to Items and Failure to Return Items</em></p>
<p>As a Borrower, you are responsible for returning the Item in the condition it was in when you received it. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Borrower, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you allow to access the Item. In the event that a Lender claims otherwise and may provide evidence of damage or non-return, including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the Lender the Security Deposit as contained in the relevant Listing. After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in your The Volte Account. The Volte also reserves the right to charge the credit card on file in your The Volte Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to The Volte in this regard, including using Security Deposits, in situations in which you have been determined, in The Volte&rsquo;s sole discretion, to have damaged any Item, or failed to return any Item, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payments made by The Volte to Lenders. If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit payment for any damage or Security Deposit to the Item to the applicable Lender or to The Volte (if applicable).</p>
<p>Both Borrowers and Lenders agree to cooperate with and assist The Volte in good faith, and to provide The Volte with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by The Volte, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Items or with respect to any investigation undertaken by The Volte or a representative of The Volte regarding use or abuse of the Site or the Services.</p>
