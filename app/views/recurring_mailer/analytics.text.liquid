Pssst, {{ user.first_name }}!

{{ user.administered_locations_pageviews_30_day_total }} people have looked at your listings over the past 30 days!

Make sure you have plenty of photos, and that they are up to date. It will make your {{ platform_context.bookable_noun }} look even better! Bookings with photos are booked 10x more than those without.

Manage {{ platform_context.bookable_noun_plural }}: {{ platform_context.host | append:user.manage_locations_url_with_tracking_and_token | append:signature_for_tracking }}

Also, check out your personal profile and fill out all the information. Don't forget a great photo of yourself! You can edit this in your personal account.

Finally, you can promote your space on social media, or reach out to Near Me and we may tweet about your space and feature the listing in our newsletter.
Spread the word to increase bookings!
