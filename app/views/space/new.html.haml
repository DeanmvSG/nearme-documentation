  %h2 How do bookings work?
  %p
    Bookings are an automated process on the Desks Near Me website, however if you
    select “Confirm Bookings” then we’ll let you approve all bookings on a case-by-case basis.

  %h2 How do I get paid?
  %p
    Desks Near Me takes payment for your booking and deposits the money into your account.
    Desks Near Me charges a 5% commission on each booking sale.

  %h2 Can I have different prices for different desks or rooms?
  %p
    Yes! Desks Near Me lets you define each desk or room in your space separately if you wish.
    You might have a conference room at $100/day but a desk at $10/day.

  %h2 My question isn't here
  %p
    No problem. Drop us a line at #{mail_to "hello@desksnear.me"} and we’ll be happy to help you out!
