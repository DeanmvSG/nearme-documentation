Hi there!  Michelle here from the NearMe team.

Thanks for your interest in NearMe (http://near-me.com).

Here's a very short, personal hello video (https://plus.google.com/u/0/113390569055627999995/posts/KfV7eyTvMBF) I want to share with you.

Just around the corner we'll be opening up our platform for a public beta.
At the moment we do have a private beta for select clients big and small.

If you have a marketplace idea that you want to start, reply to me now to be a part of our private beta.

In the meantime please follow us @NearMeCo (https://twitter.com/NearMeCo) and on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/NearMeCo) for best practices for successful marketplace, community building and industry news in the sharing economy.

So, stay tuned! You'll automatically be the first to know about our product launch!

Happy New Year!
Michelle
