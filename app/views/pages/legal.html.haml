      ## 14. Applicable Law and Venue

Therefore, you and Desks Near Me explicitly agree that all disputes, claims or other matters arising from or relating to your use of the Site will be governed by the laws of the State of California and the federal laws applicable therein.

If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.

Desks Near Me may assign any or all of its rights hereunder to any party without your consent.  You are not permitted to assign any of your rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Desks Near Me, and any such attempted assignment will be void and unenforceable.  These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Desks Near Me regarding your use of the Site, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications whether electronic, oral or written between you and Desks Near Me regarding your use of the Site.  The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
