Dear <%= @user %>,

Unfortunately, your booking at <%= @listing %> has been cancelled.

<%= render :partial => "shared/mailers/booking_details", :locals => { :listing => @listing, :reservation => @reservation } %>
This booking was previously confirmed, but the plans have changed. I’m sure it’s nothing personal. Good luck finding another workplace or booking for this one on another day :)
