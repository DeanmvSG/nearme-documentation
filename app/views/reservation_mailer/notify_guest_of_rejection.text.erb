The booking that you made on <%= @reservation.created_at.strftime("%A, %e %B") %> for '<%= @listing.name %>' at <%= link_to(@listing.location.name, location_url(@listing.location)) %> was declined by the host.

I'm sure it's not personal - they were probably just busy that day.

Don't worry - <%= link_to 'find other locations near you', search_url %>!
