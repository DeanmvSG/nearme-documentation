Hey <%= @user.first_name %>,

This is just a quick note to let you know that we've made some changes to our website that may affect how you login.

We have discontinued support for OpenID as a login provider going forward. According to our records, you have previously linked your account with OpenID.

Unfortunately, this means that you will have to login with your email and password until you connect with another supported provider (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn).

If you don't remember the password to your account, you may have to reset your account password at the link below:

<%= new_user_password_url %>

Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience this may cause. If there's anything we can do to help, please don't hesitate to let us know.

Kind regards,

The DesksNearMe Team
