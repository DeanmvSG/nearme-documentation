      %h2 Can I confirm new bookings?
      %p
        Bookings are an automated process on the Desks Near Me website, however if you
        select “Confirm Bookings” then we’ll let you approve all bookings on a case-by-case basis.

      %h2 How do I get paid?
      %p
        Desks Near Me is free to use!  We are building a great payment tool for you to take payments online through our booking engine. Stay tuned for that to be available in the next month.

      %h2 Can I have different prices for different desks or rooms?
      %p
        Yes! Desks Near Me lets you define each desk or room in your space separately if you wish.
        You might have a conference room at $100/day but a desk at $10/day.
